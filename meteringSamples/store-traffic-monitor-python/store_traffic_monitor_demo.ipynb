    "# Store Traffic Monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "Store traffic monitor is an advanced use-case example, which builds on the two previous examples (<a href=\"../flaw-detector-python/flawdetector-demo.ipynb\">flaw detector</a> and <a href=\"../object-detection-python/object_detection_demo.ipynb\">object detector</a>) and shows how a user can perform object detection and inference on multiple videos simultaneously. In this use case, the application monitors the activity of people inside and outside an imaginary store as well as keeps track of product inventory using a pre-trained neural network for detection. This application is capable of detecting objects on any number of screens as long as sufficient compute power is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo assumes you have already tried the <a href=\"../object-detection-python/object_detection_demo.ipynb\">object detector</a> sample. If you have not done so already, we recommend going through that sample first to understand the workflow for developing a deep learning application using OpenVINO. \n",

    "## Overview of How it works?\n",
    "\n",
    "The counter uses the inference engine included in the OpenVINO™ toolkit. A trained neural network detects objects within a designated area and displays a green bounding box over them. This reference implementation identifies multiple intruding objects entering the frame and identifies their class, count, and time entered. \n",
    "\n",
    "At start-up, the sample application reads a configuration file and loads a network and images from the video input to the Inference Engine (IE) plugin. At runtime, computations are offloaded to a the hardware accelerator (Intel® Core CPU, Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Xeon CPU, Intel® Movidius™ and/or Neural Compute Stick). Once the inference is completed, the output videos are appropriately rendered and stored in the /results directory, which can then be viewed within the Jupyter Notebook instance\n",

    "## Demonstration objectives\n",
    "* Video as input is supported using **OpenCV**\n",

    "* **OpenCV** provides the bounding boxes, labels and other information\n",
