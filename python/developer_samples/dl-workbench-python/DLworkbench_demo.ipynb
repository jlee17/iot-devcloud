    "This notebook sample demonstrates how to run DL -(Deep Learning) Workbench on the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge(stable version 2020R1).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of how it works\n",
    "DL Workbench is a GUI based profiler that helps visualize the performance of deep learning models and datasets on various intel® architecture configurations (currently only supports CPU, GPU, and VPU.)\n",
    "This tool runs within a docker container\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstration objectives\n",
    "* Run the DLWorkbench docker container directly on any Edge compute node (CPU, GPU and VPU) \n",
    "* Note it takes a few minutes to run the DL Workbench on the Edge compute Node and presents an URL \n",
    "* User can click on the Unique URL generated to start the browser based GUI of the DL Workbench\n",
    "* The User completes rest of the DL Workbench workflow from the browser based GUI\n",
    "* Please note: The data is not archived at this point, when you close the DL Workbench, all data is lost.\n",
