The topology used is the DenseNet 121, this architecture has shown to be very efficient at this problem, it was the first work to claim classification rate better than practicing radiologists. The dataset used for training is from the \"Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification\" [3] with a CC BY 4.0 license.\n",
