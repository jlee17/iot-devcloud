    "This application is one of a series of IoT reference implementations illustrating how to develop a working solution for a problem. The reference implementation demonstrates how to create a smart video IoT solution using Intel® hardware and software tools. This solution detects any number of objects in a designated area, providing the number of objects in the frame and total count.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of how it works\n",
    "At start-up the sample application reads the equivalent of command line arguments and loads a network and image from the video input to the Inference Engine (IE) plugin. A job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2 and and Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA.\n",
    "After the inference is completed, the output videos are appropriately stored in the /results/[device] directory, which can then be viewed within the Jupyter Notebook instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstration objectives\n",
    "* Video as input is supported using **OpenCV**\n",
    "* Inference performed on edge hardware (rather than on the development node hosting this Jupyter notebook)\n",
    "* **OpenCV** provides the bounding boxes, labels and other information\n",
    "* Visualization of the resulting bounding boxes\n",

    "- `-l` : this option let us select the number and the type of nodes using `nodes={node_count}:{property}`. \n",
    "- `-F` : this option let us send arguments to the bash script. \n",
    "- `-N` : this option let use name the job so that it is easier to distinguish between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-F` flag is used to pass in arguments to the job script.\n",
    "The [intruder_detector.sh](intruder_detector.sh) takes in 3 arguments:\n",
    "1. the path to the directory for the output video and performance stats\n",
    "2. targeted device (e.g. CPU, GPU, MYRIAD, HDDL or HETERO:FPGA,CPU)\n",
    "3. the floating precision to use for inference\n",
