    "\n",
    "This is a sample reference implementation to showcase object detection (car in this case) with single-shot detection (SSD) and Async API.\n",
    "Async API improves the overall frame-rate of the application by not waiting for the inference to complete but continuing to do things on the host while inference accelerator is busy. \n",

    "## Overview of how it works\n",

    "A job is submitted to run the inference executable on a hardware accelerator (Intel® Core CPU, Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Core CPU, Intel® Movidius™ and/or Neural Compute Stick).\n",
    "After the inference is completed, the output videos are appropriately stored in the /results directory, which can then be viewed within the Jupyter Notebook instance.\n",
