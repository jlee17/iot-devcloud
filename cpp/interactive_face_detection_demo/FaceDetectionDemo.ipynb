    "# Interactive Face Detection Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample showcases Object Detection task applied for face recognition using sequence of neural networks.\n",
    "Async API usage can improve overall frame-rate of the application, because rather than wait for inference to complete,\n",
    "the application can continue operating on the host while accelerator is busy.\n",
    "This sample maintains three parallel infer requests for the Age/Gender Recognition, Head Pose Estimation, and Emotions Recognition that run simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sample objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\tVideo as input support via OpenCV\n",
    "*\tVisualization of the resulting face bounding boxes from Face Detection network\n",
    "*\tVisualization of age/gender, head pose and emotion information for each detected face\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV is used to draw resulting bounding boxes, labels, and other information. You can copy and paste this code without pulling Inference Engine sample helpers into your application\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "*\tThe application reads command line parameters and loads up to four networks depending on `-m...` options family to the Inference Engine.\n",
    "*\tThe application gets a frame from the OpenCV's VideoCapture.\n",
    "*\tThe application performs inference on the frame detection network.\n",
    "*\tThe application performs three simultaneous inferences, using the Age/Gender, Head Pose and Emotions detection networks if they are specified in command line.\n",
    "*\tThe application displays the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new Async API operates with a new notion of the Infer Request that encapsulates the inputs/outputs and separates scheduling and waiting for result. For more information about Async API and the difference between Sync and Async modes performance, refer to **How it Works** and **Async API** sections in [Object Detection SSD, Async API Performance Showcase Sample](@ref InferenceEngineObjectDetectionSSDDemoAsyncApplication).\n",
