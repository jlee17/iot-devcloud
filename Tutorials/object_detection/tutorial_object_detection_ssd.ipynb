    "- If 'n' is '*', it means that the cell is currently executing.  \n",
    "- Once a cell is done executing, 'n' will appear as a number incrementing with each cell execution to indicate where in the sequence the cell has been executed.  Any output (e.g. print()'s) from the code will appear below the cell.\n",
    "    - Note: If you need to stop a cell during execution, for example during a long video, you can use the \"Stop\" button at the top (square to the right of the \"Run\" button).  After stopping the cell, you may re-execute it if needed."

This tutorial will go step-by-step through the necessary steps to demonstrate object detection on images and video.  Object detection is performed using a pre-trained network and running it using the OpenVINO™ toolkit Inference Engine.  Inference will be executed using the same CPU(s) running this Jupyter Notebook.\n",

    "## OpenVINO™ Toolkit Overview and Terminology \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin with a brief overview of the OpenVINO™ toolkit and what this tutorial will be covering.  The OpenVINO™ toolkit enables the quick deployment of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for heterogeneous execution on Intel® hardware while maximizing performance. This is done using the Intel® Deep Learning Deployment Toolkit (Intel® DL Deployment Toolkit) included within the OpenVINO™ toolkit with its main components shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image alt text](./doc_openvino_overview_image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic flow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a tool, such as Caffe, to create and train a CNN inference model\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the created model through Model Optimizer to produce an optimized Intermediate Representation (IR) stored in files (.bin and .xml) for use with the Inference Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The User Application then loads and runs models on devices using the Inference Engine and the IR files  \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will focus on the last step, the User Application and using the Inference Engine to run a model on CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Inference Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a more detailed view of the User Application and Inference Engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image alt text](./doc_inference_engine_image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Inference Engine includes a plugin library for each supported device that has been optimized for the Intel® hardware device CPU, GPU, and Myriad.  From here, we will use the terms \"device\" and “plugin” with the assumption that one infers the other (e.g. CPU device infers the CPU plugin and vice versa).  As part of loading the model, the User Application tells the Inference Engine which device to target which in turn loads the associated plugin library to later run on the associated device. The Inference Engine uses “blobs” for all data exchanges, basically arrays in memory arranged according the input and output data of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inference Engine API Integration Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Inference Engine API follows the basic steps outlined briefly below.  The API objects and functions will be seen later in the sample code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Read the model IR\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Load the model into the plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Prepare the input\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Run Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Process the output\n",

    "## Input Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the dimensions of the input data does not match the required dimensions of the input data for the inference model.  A common example is an input video frame.  Before the image may be input to the inference model, the input must be preprocessed to match the required dimensions for the inference model as well as channels (i.e. colors) and batch size (number of images present).  The basic step performed is to resize the frame from the source dimensions to match the required dimensions of the inference model’s input, reorganizing any dimensions as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial and the many samples in the OpenVINO™ toolkit use OpenCV to perform resizing of input data.  The basic steps performed using OpenCV are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Resize image dimensions form image to model's input W x H:\n",
    "    frame = cv2.resize(image, (w, h))\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Change data layout from (H x W x C) to (C x H x W)\n",
    "    frame = frame.transpose((2, 0, 1))  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reshape to match input dimensions\n",
